# Sign language detector
This Python project focuses on American Sign Language (ASL) detection using computer vision techniques. The application utilizes OpenCV for video processing, MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and Tkinter for building a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tanx-123/Sign-language-detector.git
    cd Sign-language-detector
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the application using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will open a window displaying the feed from your webcam. Position your hand within the frame to see the detected ASL sign prediction.
